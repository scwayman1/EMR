/**
 * Clinician Approvals Inbox
 *
 * The single place a provider goes to see every agent-produced artifact
 * waiting for their sign-off. Today that's primarily Nurse Nora's message
 * drafts. The shape is general: any approval-gated agent output can land
 * here as an {@link ApprovalItem} with a consistent review card.
 *
 * Why this exists: before this page, drafts were scattered inside individual
 * patient charts. A clinician had to know to go look. That defeats the
 * purpose of having agents work for you in the background. Now the drafts
 * come to you.
