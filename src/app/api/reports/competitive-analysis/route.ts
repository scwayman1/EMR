      "3. ONLINE SCHEDULING — ArfinnMed has patient self-scheduling with prepaid options. Build the scheduling calendar (EMR-155).",
      "4. E-CONSENT FORMS — ArfinnMed has customizable e-consent. Build consent form builder (EMR-179).",
      "5. CUSTOM INTAKE BUILDER — ArfinnMed allows custom intake forms. Consider a drag-and-drop form builder.",

    verdict: "Leafjourney significantly outperforms ArfinnMed in AI capabilities (40+ agents vs none), billing/RCM (full pipeline vs none), clinical decision support, and the e-prescribe workflow. ArfinnMed's key advantages are state compliance reporting, integrated telehealth, and scheduling — all of which are addressable with targeted development. Our AI orchestration layer is a fundamental architectural advantage that ArfinnMed cannot easily replicate.",
