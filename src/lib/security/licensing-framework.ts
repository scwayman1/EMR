/**
 * EMR-084 — Licensing + IP framework.
 *
 * The encryption side of EMR-084 lives in `./encryption-framework.ts`. This
 * companion module is the *legal / commercial* surface: the set of
 * artifacts a sales engineer or counsel needs when pitching Leafjourney
 * to a hospital system, Epic / Cerner partner, or PT/OT chain.
 *
 * The data is intentionally static and version-controlled here (rather
 * than living in a CMS) so:
 *   1. Changes are reviewed alongside code.
 *   2. The licensing brochure endpoint can re-render deterministically.
 *   3. The compliance audit page can show "what we license, against
 *      which claims, with which sample contract."
 *
 * Counsel reviewed shape:
 *   - LICENSEE_TIERS         — outpatient → hospital pricing buckets
 *   - INTELLECTUAL_PROPERTY  — patent + trademark claim inventory
 *   - COMPLIANCE_ATTESTATIONS — what Leafjourney represents to a buyer
 *   - SAMPLE_CONTRACTS       — boilerplate MSA + DPA + BAA templates
