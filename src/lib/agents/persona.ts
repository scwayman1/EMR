/**
 * Shared agent persona / voice layer.
 *
 * The UI registry in `./ui-registry.ts` defines how an agent APPEARS
 * (display name, glyph, accent color). This file defines how an agent
 * SOUNDS — the tone, the phrases we refuse to use, the shape of a
 * sign-off, and how we address the patient in front of us.
 *
 * Every patient-facing agent imports from here so Leafjourney
 * speaks with one warm, reliable voice across every touchpoint. This
 * is the Constitution talking: Article IV §4 — "This isn't MyChart.
 * This is MyStory. This isn't a patient's medical history. This is a
 * patient's medical journey. Speak to them accordingly."
 *
 * Pure TypeScript. No React. No Prisma. Trivially importable from any
 * agent without pulling in the rest of the platform.
