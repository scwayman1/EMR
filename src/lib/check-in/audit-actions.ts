// Canonical audit action names for the QR rescue check-in surfaces.
//
// Audit rules (security contract): record QR generation, QR view, QR
// redeem, failed/expired token attempts, and intake submissions. NEVER log raw
// tokens or free-text PHI — metadata is limited to opaque ids, the QR token
// *hash* (not the token), milestone/channel, and a failure reason enum.
//
// The pre-visit completion reminder audit action lives with the sender as
// PREVISIT_COMPLETION_REMINDER_ACTION ("previsit.completion.reminder.sent").
