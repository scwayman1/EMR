/**
 * Public surface of the scheduling engine (Phase 12 Track 3).
 *
 * Re-exports the pure, dependency-free algorithm modules so callers can
 * `import { rankSlots, rankWaitlist, computeMetrics } from "@/lib/scheduling"`
 * instead of reaching into individual files. Only deterministic, DB-free
 * modules are surfaced here — the server-side dispatch worker
 * (`send-reminders.ts`, which talks to Prisma + the SMS adapter) is
 * intentionally excluded so this barrel stays safe to import from any layer.
 *
 * Note: `analytics.ts` and `workflow-efficiency.ts` each export a local
 * `percentile` helper with different conventions (linear-interpolated vs.
 * nearest-rank). Per ES module semantics that name is ambiguous through the
 * barrel and is omitted — import it from the specific module if you need it.
