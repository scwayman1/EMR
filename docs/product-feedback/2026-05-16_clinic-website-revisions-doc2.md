# LeafJourney /clinic Website Revisions — Round 1 (Desktop)

**Source:** Dr. N. Patel (founder, clinical lead) — customer development working document
**Date captured:** 2026-05-16
**Doc type:** Heterogeneous product feedback (page-by-page website review)
**Scope:** Desktop / computer site only. Mobile site comes after desktop is cleaned up.
**Status:** TRUNCATED — original message ended mid-`/clinic/communications/fax` page. Remainder to be appended when received.

---

## Source preface (verbatim)

> I will begin going through every single page of our www.LeafJourney.com/clinic website and will go over the suggestions and what we need to clean up. This will be strictly for the desktop and computer site. Once this is fully cleaned up, de-bugged, and operational, I will begin going through the mobile site.

---

## Cross-cutting / global behaviors

These apply across the entire EMR (patient portal, clinician portal, owner/practice management portal) — not specific to any one page.

- **"Send Whisper" comment-bubble routing.** For every page that has the small green-circle "comment bubble" in the bottom-left corner, the "Send Whisper" button must email the suggestion to `neal@leafjourney.com` AND `scott@leafjourney.com`.
- **Required-field validation pattern.** For any required text field left empty or incorrectly filled: show small-font message "please complete each field" AND highlight each unfilled field with a bright red border. **Applies across entire EMR** — patient portal, clinician portal, owner/practice management portal.
- **Leaf-emoji substitution for status bubbles.** Across the entire EMR, replace red/yellow/green status "bubbles" with larger red leaf / yellow leaf / green leaf emojis. Hover (desktop) and tap (iPhone/iPad) reveal a small popup with the meaning.
- **Audio retention policy (MAKE EXPLICIT TO ALL AI AGENTS).** LeafJourney does NOT store any audio anywhere in the system for more than 30 days. All servers across all platforms must auto-delete audio. This is to protect voice signatures of patients/staff/users.

---

## Page: `https://leafjourney.com/clinic` (main page)

- Left-side ribbon menu must scroll with the page — entire ribbon visible regardless of scroll position.
- **"New Visit" box** — clicking opens a modal:
  - Free-text "Patient name" field
  - "DOB" field that auto-populates based on patient name
  - "Type of visit" dropdown: History and Physical, Follow Up, New Patient, Custom (free text)
  - "Date" field: free-typeable (e.g. `08/12/1990`) OR opens iOS-style mini calendar with clickable month/day
  - **Duplicate-resolution flow:** If name or DOB matches multiple patients, open a second popup listing them as rows with columns: Patient Name, DOB, Age, Phone Number, Address — to prevent wrong-patient selection
  - Each popup needs an X at top-right OR click-outside-to-close; either action triggers a "Are you sure you want to leave?" confirm to guard against accidental exit
  - Bottom-right buttons: `Cancel` (left) and `Create` (right). Clicking Create populates the visit into `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/schedule`
- **"RELAX" button** in top ribbon next to "Hello, Dr. Lena". Opens a popup with rotating mindfulness options (X to close or click outside). Refresh button to rotate.
  - **Breathing exercises** (4-4 box, 4-7-8, etc) — each has a small visual: a ball moving up/down or in a box to follow the breath
  - **Calming artwork** — Thomas Kinkade, Picasso, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Michelangelo, etc. **DO NOT generate AI artwork for this.**
  - **Movement exercises** — 5:00 minute timer displayed at top
    - Option: movement bubble with cartoon to follow
    - Option: exercises (squats, push ups, walk, calf raises) with cartoon demos
    - Option: simple seated or standing stretches (hamstring, calf, back, shoulder) with cartoon demos
  - **Music** — ambient binaural beats (alpha waves), wind chimes, ocean waves; OR 3-5 minute classical clips (Beethoven, Mozart, Bach)
  - **Games** — simple AI-generated games (Jezzball-style, ski slope, Wordle-style) — must be unique, no copyright conflicts. Playable with mouse or arrow keys only.
- **Top-ribbon links** (must be clickable):
  - "patients today" → `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/schedule`
  - "notes to sign" → `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/sign-off`
  - "approvals" → `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/approvals`
  - "threads" → leave unlinked for now
- **"Search patients" box** — support partial name, phone (with or without hyphens), DOB, full last name, full first name, medical life number. Add a "search" button to the left of "new visit".
- **"Today's Queue"** — use AI/agents to categorize urgent vs regular based on chart context. Include important labs, consult docs, and images. Surface urgent messages (callbacks vs clarifications), urgent meds (travel, ran out, sick/needs antibiotics).
- **Move to `/clinic/command`:** "this week" visits box, "finalized notes this week" box, "visits – last 7 days" box.
- **"Quick research" bar at bottom** — remove if provider does not practice cannabis. Make this part of the modular onboarding selection.

---

## Page: `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/command`

- Move "schedule" and "messages" to the `/clinic` page.
- "Clinical flow" and "clinical discovery" reset daily at 11:59 PM.
- "Clinical flow" and "clinical discovery" need a `more` button — opens popup with graph toggling Week / Month / Year tracking over that span.

---

## Page: `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/schedule`

- Right-click anywhere on schedule → dropdown menu with `new` option. Schedule new block options:
  - Time block: 5-min interval increments (5, 10, 15, …) OR customizable. Populates a same-sized box on the schedule. Free-text "notes" box. Free-text "reason" box.
  - Schedule patient (search by phone with/without hyphens, DOB, last name, first name)
  - Schedule "meeting"
  - Schedule "vacation"
  - Schedule "do not book"
- Drag-and-drop rearrange on `day`, `week`, and `list` tabs.
- Header currently shows `May 17 – 2026 (day:23)`. Remove `(Day:23)`. Replace with day-of-week: `May 17 – 2026 (Sunday)`.
- Incorporate the New Visit box behaviors described in the main-page section.

---

## Page: `https://leafjourney.com/telehealth`

- Add large video/plus icon to right of "Video Visits" → opens popup with free-text search: name, phone, DOB, partial name, OR email (emails patient a HIPAA-compliant clickable telemed link).
- Inside the call, small microphone icon toggles ambient AI scribe — takes notes without recording personal data.
- **Pre-visit checklist** — every bullet must be something the EMR can actually verify.
  - Verified/working bullets render in **green** font with a small **green leaf** icon
  - Failing bullets render in **red** font with a **dried brown leaf** icon
  - Both colors must be relatively dark and readable in bright environments

---

## Page: `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/patients`

---

## Page: `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/messages`

- **"New Message" button** to right of "search patient or message" box. Opens popup:
  - Free-text `name` (searchable by partial last name, partial first name, DOB; dropdown shows full name + DOB + years old)
  - Free-text `message`
  - `Send` and `Cancel` at bottom
- **Hover on initials circle** (e.g., "MR" for Maya Reyes) reveals: current meds (scrollable to save space).
- **Patient name in message window is a clickable link** to chart front page (e.g., `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/patients/cmo37j5gt000el82q44u6x1sv`).
- **On patient chart, the message thread becomes a Gmail-style pop-up/docked compose** at bottom-right. Scrollable, send button bottom-right. Reference: https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/gmail-rolls-out-new-pop-out-window-for-composing-emails/
  - Pop-up mode: freely draggable within the chart
  - Docked mode: static bottom-right
- **Memo and Rx icons** in message window, to the right of the video icon.
  - **Rx icon** → links to patient's prescribe page (e.g., `/clinic/patients/.../prescribe`) while keeping the message box pop-up/docked
  - **Memo icon** → internal-only message (pop-up/docked). Recipients: staff, MA, front office, back office, provider (other practice providers). Header shows patient's name + DOB. `Cancel` (deletes) or `Send` (lands in recipient inbox).
- **Slash-command referral system** — use `/__` in message thread to refer to ancillary services (PT, OT, ST, etc).
  - Full referral system: provider maintains preferred ancillary provider list (OT, PT, ST, dental, cardiology, optometry, etc) with name, office number, fax, email, address
  - Phrases like `/refer to PT` or `/refer to Dr. Patel` use AI to pull the right data
  - Produces simple printout, OR can be emailed/texted directly to patient
  - Information flows into centralized portal for patient + provider
- **Right-click inbox** → mark as `read` / `unread`. Unread gets green dot on left of patient name.
- **Auto-save drafts** (Gmail-style). Patient name shows `(Draft)` suffix in left pane when there's an unsent message.
- **Message thread elongation cap** — extends, but stops before forcing the whole page to scroll. Page has its own scroll bar AND message thread has its own scroll bar.
- **Call/video log inside the thread** (WhatsApp-style) — actual time spent, missed audio call, missed facetime call, etc. References:
  - https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-feature-roundup-missed-call-messages-new-status-stickers-and-more
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/17wbo9d/whatsapp_calls_showing_as_chat_bubbles_inside/
- **In-thread search box** next to subject/patient name. Search words, numbers, partial numbers, date/time.
- **Attachments** — PDF, Word, JPEG. Open in split-window view with annotation tools (draw, highlight, circle, erase). Save or Discard. Annotation toolkit should be extensive like Zoom/Google but easy to navigate. Saved annotations are downloadable/shareable. Discard keeps only the original.
- **"Resolved" button** next to Send. Marking resolved drops a "resolved message" bubble with timestamp into the thread.
  - Click out anytime → message auto-saves as draft (same as Gmail)
  - New messages after resolution continue under the resolved bubble
  - One long continuous HIPAA-compliant thread per patient with everything (resolved msgs, audio calls, video calls, all timestamped)
  - Resolved threads drop out of the smart inbox until a new message reactivates them
- **Patient name dropdown → `Export`** opens popup:
  - Date range (calendar + freehand entry)
  - Send via: email / text (READ-ONLY web link) / print / fax / save as PDF (freehand text box, auto-populating where possible)

---

## Page: `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/sign-off`

- **Same split-pane layout as `/clinic/messages`** — inbox left, full thread/document right.
- Left pane shows patient `Name` + `type` of sign-off required.
- **In `/clinic/labs-review`,** clicking a patient's labs or `review` opens a popup:
  - Rename "looks good – draft outreach" → `draft message`
  - Each lab marker is clickable → opens split pane in popup showing a clean graphical trend over the past year (3mo/6mo/12mo/2yr toggle, custom range). Must include actual numerical values.
  - **Patient Message box** — 1-2 word trend sentence; for high/low/abnormal labs, explain plan of action so patient isn't worried; end with: "don't forget to watch your diet and continue exercising! Call or message us with any questions. Thank you!" (warm/friendly tone)
  - **MA task box** — keep current recommendations
  - **Chart note box** — keep the one-liner, state "labs reviewed" + communicated to patient
  - Option to send labs WITH patient message via `Send` button — routes to phone (text) or email per `Communication Preferences` in `/portal/profile`
  - **Patient-facing PDF format** — one-page printable/shareable. Includes "Results", "What these mean", "Patient message" sections. Every marker has a plain-language explanation: what it means, what it does in the body, what high/low/abnormal results mean. AI must reliably tag markers as high/low/abnormal.
  - Right-pane document view: full expanded, scrollable, zoomable, OCR-compliant, highlightable
  - Right-pane top ribbon (consistent): initials avatar, patient name (links to chart front page), call/video/message/Rx icons
  - **Message icon → internal messaging** to staff/MA/front office/back office/provider (e.g. "make an appointment", "do blood work before sending Rx", reasons meds were denied)

- **REMOVE "Approvals" entirely.** Replace with this structure under `/clinic/sign-off`. Each subpage lists everything in that category in time-of-import order, with sort options for date / time / alphabetical:
  - **Clinical Encounter Documentation** → `/clinic/sign-off/clinicdocs`
    - Progress Notes (SOAP)
    - History & Physical (H&P) — required within 30 days prior or 24 hours after admission

  - **Administrative and Compliance** → `/clinic/sign-off/administrative`
    - Informed Consent Forms
    - Attestations (work of residents / non-physician practitioners)
    - Problem List Updates
    - Patient Instructions
  - **Refills** → `/clinic/sign-off/refills`

- **Refills page** — same split-pane layout. Right pane shows full Rx/refill module for the selected medication. Information density is high; design for visual clarity, consider trimming if needed:
  - **Patient info:** Name (first+last), Gender (M/F), DOB, Address, Phone, Last appt date, Next appt date
  - **Pharmacy info:** NCPDPID, State License #, DEA #, NPI #, Name, Address, Telephone, Fax
  - **Prescriber info:** DEA #, NPI #, Name, Address, Telephone, Fax
  - **Medication info:** Name, Dose, SIG, Product code, Quantity, Days supply, Refill count, Last refill date
  - **`Prescribe` and `Deny` buttons** bottom-right:
    - `Prescribe` → e-sign with 4-digit provider passcode tied to NPI
    - `Deny` → rejection sent to pharmacy AND documented in chart
    - Provider can use message icon afterward to ping internal staff (MA/front/back office/nurse)
  - Clicking patient name in Refill Queue opens popup where:
    - Patient name links to chart front page
    - Section labeled `REFILLS`
    - `Edit` button to LEFT of `Deny` and `Approve & Send to Pharmacy`
    - `Edit` → links to patient's cannabis prescription page (e.g., `/clinic/patients/cmo37joir0048l82qqlzr322j/prescribe`)
    - If provider sends from there, the refill disappears from the Refill Queue

---

## Page: `https://leafjourney.com/clinic/providers`

- **Provider-to-provider secure messaging via SMS.** Send a text saying "secure message from Dr. Patel" with a 24-hour-expiring HIPAA-compliant link to a web-based secure messaging site.

    - Saved → goes into chart as "chart note" or "correspondence"
    - Not saved → lives only in `/clinic/providers/messages`
- `/clinic/providers/messages` layout = iMessage style. Left pane = list of contacts; right pane = full thread.
- **Left-pane search** — partial first name, partial last name, specialty (endocrinology, cardiology, rheumatology, etc).
- **Opt-in/opt-out for SMS** — directory contacts must consent to texting.
- **Attachments via `/_`** — e.g. `"Hi Dr. Patel, it's Dr. Daliwala. I just saw your patient and got the /X-ray of chest results."` Slash-command pulls the impression of the X-ray; the phrase becomes a hyperlink to the image or finalized radiology report.
- **Provider name popup** — clicking name shows: provider name, clinic address, clinic phone, clinic fax, picture, website. Close via X or click-outside.
- **"Secure message" opens Gmail-style pane** — contact list left, thread right. Running dialogue. Secure message + secure call available.
  - Each provider opts in/out of call AND message independently
  - Opt-out providers can still choose which info appears in directory (e.g., opt out of calls/msgs, opt in to practice address, phone, fax)
